## ðŸ’¡ LLM Smart Prompting Highlights

As per the assessment instructions, the following parts were efficiently implemented using LLM prompting:
- Simplifying GitHub webhook JSON - Prompted for extracting only essential fields like author, branch, timestamp
- Detecting PR merge vs open
- Timestamp formatting - Asked LLM to convert ISO to readable UTC string in JavaScript
- Minimal UI - Prompted LLM for polling HTML layout with clean design 
- MongoDB schema - Generated a compact event schema: type, author, from_branch, to_branch, timestamp
